Quantum Simulation

This is for my senior project in computer science at Kansas State University. It involves using [QuEST](https://quest.qtechtheory.org) to run simulations of quantum algorithms. The ultimate objective is to develop a new quantum algorithm for a problem of my choosing.

To Run: Use 'make' to compile and './qsim' to run. You'll want to make sure gcc isn't super out of date and set the values in the makefile to match your configuration. Check out the QuEST [GitHub](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST/blob/master/examples/README.md) on how to set it up.
